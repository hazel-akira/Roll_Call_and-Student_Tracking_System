# Filament admin panels

The Laravel backend includes two [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) panels for operational management alongside the Next.js app.

## Panels

| Panel | URL | Who can sign in |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| **Admin** | `/admin` | Users with role `admin` or `ict_staff` |
| **Teacher** | `/teacher` | Users with role `teacher`, `admin`, or `ict_staff` |

Users must be `active` and allowed for the panel role. They can sign in with **Microsoft SSO** (when `MICROSOFT_SSO_ENABLED=true`) or with **email and password** if a panel password has been set in the admin **Users** screen.

## Microsoft SSO

Microsoft sign-in is available in two places:

| Surface | How it works |
|---------|----------------|
| **Next.js app** | Browser MSAL login → `POST /api/v1/auth/microsoft/exchange` |
| **Filament `/admin` and `/teacher`** | “Continue with Microsoft” on the login page → OAuth callback at `/auth/microsoft/callback` |

### Backend environment

```env
MICROSOFT_SSO_ENABLED=true
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=<entra-app-id>
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET=<entra-client-secret>
MICROSOFT_ALLOWED_TENANT_IDS=<azure-tenant-id>
MICROSOFT_JWKS_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/discovery/v2.0/keys
MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/microsoft/callback
```

`MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_URI` defaults to `{APP_URL}/auth/microsoft/callback` when omitted.

### Entra app registration

Use the **same app registration**, but register redirect URIs on the **correct platform**. A URI can only belong to one platform type.

| Platform | URI | Used by |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Single-page application** | `http://localhost:3000/callback` | Next.js (`npm run dev`) |
| **Web** | `http://localhost:8000/auth/microsoft/callback` | Filament `/admin` and `/teacher` |

**Important:** Do **not** put `http://localhost:3000/callback` under **Web**. If you do, the Next.js app fails with `AADSTS9002326` (cross-origin token redemption only allowed for SPA).

For production, use your HTTPS domains on the same platform types.

New Microsoft users are created as **active teachers** when `AUTH_AUTO_ACTIVATE_SSO_USERS=true` (default). Teachers without a school assignment complete setup in the Next.js app at `/onboarding/schools` after their first sign-in.

When `AUTH_AUTO_ACTIVATE_SSO_USERS=false`, new users remain **pending** until an admin grants access and (for teachers) assigns at least one school.

## Admin panel

- **Schools** — create and edit schools (name, code, level, Dynamics ID, active flag).
- **Users** — manage everyone who signs in to Roll Call:
  - **Awaiting access** tab — users who tried Microsoft sign-in but are not approved yet (`pending`).
  - **Grant access** — assign role + schools and activate the account (one-click from the list or edit screen).
  - **Revoke access** — set account to inactive.
  - **School access** — multi-select on the form or the School access relation tab.
  - **Microsoft sign-in** tab — see when they last attempted SSO.

When auto-activation is disabled (`AUTH_AUTO_ACTIVATE_SSO_USERS=false`), new users remain pending until an admin grants access and assigns schools.

Administrators and ICT staff can access all schools in the API without explicit assignments. Teachers must be linked to at least one school before they can use tenant-scoped features; they can self-select schools on first login when auto-activation is enabled.

## Teacher panel

- **Attendance sessions** — list and create roll-call sessions for classes the user can access; close open sessions from the edit screen.

Teachers only see their own sessions. Admins and ICT staff see all sessions (or those in assigned schools if school links exist).

## First-time setup

From `backend/`:

```bash
composer install
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan make:filament-user
```

Choose the **admin** panel when prompted, or create a user in **Users** with role Administrator and a password, then open `/admin`.

For local development, run the API server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` or `/teacher`.

## Environment

Filament uses the default `web` session guard (`config/auth.php`). No extra env keys are required beyond a working database and `APP_URL`.

Optional seed admin (API/SSO) without a panel password:

```env
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
SEED_ADMIN_NAME="Platform Administrator"
```

Set a password for that user in **Users** before using Filament login.
